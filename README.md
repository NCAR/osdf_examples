# OSDF_Examples

## About
Contains Jupyter notebook workflows which access climate data from various [OSDF](https://osg-htc.org/services/osdf.html) origins using [PelicanFS](https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelicanfs). The examples include workflows where computations are executed on various platforms like NCAR's Casper, TACC's Stampede3 and cloud computing platforms like Jetstream2. 


## Example Workflows
1) Accessing CESM2 LENS data from the AWS opendata origin and the NCAR data origin and
a) Bias-correct surface temperature using ERA5 reanalysis. The notebook can be found [here](jupyter_notebooks/cesm_bias.ipynb)
b) Compute surface ocean heat content. The notebook can be found [here](jupyter_notebooks/cesm_oceanheat.ipynb)
2) Accessing NOAA SONAR data from the AWS origin to plot echograms. [Here](jupyter_notebooks/sonar_ai.ipynb) is the notebook.
